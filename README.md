## Challenges

- In **Test Scenario 2**, adding a second item was not always possible because product attributes are dynamic (size or color varies by product), which made it difficult to use stable locators.
- Products change every **24 hours**, so available items and attributes may differ depending on the product type.
- Verifying the product name was inconsistent, as the name in the cart sometimes appears in a different format than the one shown on the product details page.
